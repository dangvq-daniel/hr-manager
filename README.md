# HR Manager
HR Manager is an Android application designed to store and manage employee information. 
HR Manager begins by introducing a first time user with a login screen where a tier one or a tier two user can register or log into the application.
The application functions slightly differently depending on whether a tier one or tier two user is logged in, but always keeps a user logged in even if they
exit the app. 
Tier one users can only view the information in the application while tier two users can view and edit the information in the application.
The app at its core features a table of employees upon which a user can view or edit (only tier 2 users can edit) the information stored. The user
can sort the table using a variety of employee traits.
Additionally, there is a search bar built into the application to allow the user to look up a particular employee in the table based on employee 
details such as name or department (full keyword searches only).
When the user is done with the application, they can simply log out with the press of a button.
